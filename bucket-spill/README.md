`bucket-spill` checks out all the [GitBucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) Git repos a user has, and **spill** them into a nice subdirectory structure.

It also has a few various actions to be able to get more information out of the GitBucket system.

Prerequisites is Gradle >= 6.x *(e.g. by installing using [SDKMAN](http://sdkman.io/))*.
